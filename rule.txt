Basic Play

Player's toss a coin to decide who will play white - white moves first and has a slight 
advantage as a result. Play is in two phases. To begin with, players take turns to play 
a piece of their own colour on any unoccupied point until all eighteen pieces have been 
played. After that, play continues alternately but each turn consists of a player moving 
one piece along a line to an adjacent point.

During both of these phases, whenever a player achieves a mill, that player immediately 
removes from the board one piece belonging to the opponent that does not form part of a 
mill. If all the opponents pieces form mills then an exception is made and the player is 
allowed to remove any piece. It is only upon the formation of a mill that a piece is 
captured but a player will often break a mill by moving a piece out of it and then, in a 
subsequent turn, play the piece back again, thus forming a new mill and capturing another 
piece.

Captured pieces are never replayed onto the board and remain captured for the remainder 
of the game. The game is finished when a player loses either by being reduced to two pieces 
or by being unable to move.
